# C# Refactoring Exercise: Order Processing System

We'd like to give you a chance to demonstrate your C# skills and problem-solving approach by working on a refactoring exercise.

You'll be provided with a C# console application that simulates a basic order processing system. The existing code functions, but there's room for improvement in terms of code quality, maintainability, and potentially some hidden bugs or inefficiencies.

Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas for improvement, and refactor it to adhere to best practices and clean code principles. Feel free to add unit tests, apply design patterns, or make any other changes you deem necessary to enhance the codebase.

## Key Focus Areas:

- Code readability and maintainability
- Testability
- Potential performance improvements
- Application of SOLID principles or other design patterns (if applicable)

## Time:

You'll have 40 minutes for this exercise.

## Expectations:

- We're not expecting you to complete everything perfectly within the time limit.
- Focus on demonstrating your understanding of C# best practices, refactoring skills, and problem-solving approach.
- Feel free to ask clarifying questions or discuss your thought process as you work.

**We're excited to see your approach to this exercise and discuss your refactoring choices!**

## Additional Notes:

- You can use any resources or tools you're comfortable with during the exercise.
- The provided code is a simplified representation of a real-world scenario. The focus is on your ability to analyze and improve existing code, not on building a complete order processing system.

Please let us know when you're ready to begin!
